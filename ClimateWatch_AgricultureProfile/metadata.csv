Gross output relates directly to the concept of value added as the latter is obtained by subtracting the value of intermediate consumption evaluated at purchasers' prices from the value of output at basic prices. Although the outputs and inputs are valued using different sets of prices, for brevity the value added is described by the prices used to value the outputs. From the point of view of the producer, purchasers' prices for inputs and basic prices for outputs represent the prices actually paid and received. Their use leads to a measure of gross value added that is particularly relevant for the producer.

FAOSTAT_6,Agri-Environmental indicators,FAOSTAT Water Withdrawal Database,Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/?#data/EW,Agricultural water withdrawal as percentage of total water withdrawal (summed by sector),"The agricultural sector uses a considerable share of the available water resources. An increase of irrigated area in a country or region could imply an increase of water use for agriculture. Knowing that a certain area is equipped to be irrigated does not mean that it has been irrigated in a specific year. The indicator Agricultural Water Withdrawal assesses the total amount of water used for irrigation. Irrigation represents the main use of water in agriculture and one of the main uses of water resources in general. Trends in water abstraction may depend on several factors, such as crop type, irrigation technology, water prices, and climatic conditions. Agricultural water withdrawal is a serious concern especially in arid and semi-arid areas, where water is scarce and highly variable from year to year. In dry regions it is necessary to irrigate certain crops to obtain reasonable yields. In addition to lower income for the farmer, low yields will also mean that less fertilizer nitrogen is removed from the fields with harvested crops, and thereby leaving excess nitrogen (N) in the soil resulting in potentially higher risk for leaching during the following period. Furthermore, increased water abstraction may also cause salinisation and contamination of water with other pollutants. The indicator in EUROSTAT and OECD frameworks: Eurostat: AEI n.20.

WBD,Employment in Agriculture,World Development Indicators,World Bank,http://data.worldbank.org/,Male and female employment in agriculture,"Employment is defined as persons of working age who were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit, whether at work during the reference period or not at work due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangement. The agriculture sector consists of activities in agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing, in accordance with division 1 (ISIC 2) or categories A-B (ISIC 3) or category A (ISIC 4).","Data up to 2016 are estimates while data from 2017 are projections. There are many differences in how countries define and measure employment status, particularly members of the armed forces, self-employed workers, and unpaid family workers. Where members of the armed forces are included, they are allocated to the service sector, causing that sector to be somewhat overstated relative to the service sector in economies where they are excluded. Where data are obtained from establishment surveys, data cover only employees; thus self-employed and unpaid family workers are excluded. In such cases the employment share of the agricultural sector is severely underreported. Caution should be also used where the data refer only to urban areas, which record little or no agricultural work. Moreover, the age group and area covered could differ by country or change over time within a country. For detailed information, consult the original source. Countries also take different approaches to the treatment of unemployed people. In most countries unemployed people with previous job experience are classified according to their last job. But in some countries the unemployed and people seeking their first job are not classifiable by economic activity. Because of these differences, the size and distribution of employment by economic activity may not be fully comparable across countries. The ILO reports data by major divisions of the ISIC revision 2, revision 3, or revision 4. Broad classification such as employment by agriculture, industry, and services may obscure fundamental shifts within countries' industrial patterns. A slight majority of countries report economic activity according to the ISIC revision 3 instead of revision 2 or revision 4. The use of one classification or the other should not have a significant impact on the information for the employment of the three broad sectorsdata.",Global,1991-2017,Annual,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by,"International Labour Organization, 2017.

OECD-FAO,Meat Consumption,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook: Agricultural output,OECD-FAO,https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm,"Meat consumption presented by beef and veal, pig, poultry, and sheep.","For most of the commodity markets analysed in the Outlook, detailed supply and use balances are available, as well as domestic and international commodity prices. For OECD countries, the data is accompanied by detailed meta-data. In most cases the data is going back to 1990 and extended to the latest year in the projections (currently 2027). Meat consumption is related to living standards, diet, livestock production and consumer prices, as well as macroeconomic uncertainty and shocks to GDP. Compared to other commodities, meat is characterised by high production costs and high output prices. Meat demand is associated with higher incomes and a shift - due to urbanisation - to food consumption changes that favour increased proteins from animal sources in diets. While the global meat industry provides food and a livelihood for billions of people, it also has significant environmental and health consequences for the planet.  Meat consumption is measured in thousand tonnes of carcass weight (except for poultry expressed as ready to cook weight) and in kilograms of retail weight per capita. Carcass weight to retail weight conversion factors are: 0.7 for beef and veal, 0.78 for pigmeat, and 0.88 for both sheep meat and poultry meat.","The data used to develop the projections underlying the assessment are those available as of January 2018- The projections and assessments provided in the report are the result of close co-operation between the OECD and FAO Secretariats and national experts with a jointly developed modelling system, based on the AGLINK-COSIMO model, used to facilitate consistency in the projections- The data series for the projections are drawn from OECD and FAO databases- For the most part information in these databases has been taken from national statistical sources- For further details on particular series, enquiries should be directed to the OECD and FAO Secretariats-",46 countries,1991-2017,Annual,"Except where additional restrictions apply as stated above, You can extract from, download, copy, adapt, print, distribute, share and embed Data for any purpose, even for commercial use.

This methodology addresses each of the challenges by starting with indicators that were computed within basic hydrological units and assigning spatially explicit weights to reflect the importance of the specific areas based on where water is being used. From these calculations, estimates of the average level of exposure to 5 of Aqueduct physical water-quantity risk indicators were generated for all countries and major river basins worldwide. These indicators include (1) baseline water stress: the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total available annual renewable supply; (2) interannual variability: the variation in water supply between years; (3) seasonal variability: the variation in water supply between months of the year; (4) flood occurrence: the number of floods recorded from 1985 to 2011; and (5) drought severity: the average length of drought times.","These global indicators are best suited for comparison among countries and major river basins to help companies, investors, and governments assess water-quantity-related risk at the country and basin scales, because of the inherent limitations in trying to simplify complex phenomena into a single number. Where available, more detailed, locally sourced data should be preferred for assessing water-related risks and supporting decision-making processes. Information is lost when aggregating indicators from a smaller scale. Many countries, such as the United States, and river basins, such as the Ganges-Brahmaputra, are large enough to span multiple climatic zones, and the process of averaging indicator values can disguise regions with very low or very high water-related risks. These indicators measure the underlying factors that drive water-quantity-related risks across countries and river basins, and are not designed to capture the effects of governance regimes, water quality, or investments in water-availability solutions.
